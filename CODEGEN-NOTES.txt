1. Files for testing are in ./testfiles.
2. Main EXE is at ./Compiler.exe (it can be run without paramters and you can choose a test file or a visitor from the menu).
3. There are a few requirements to have the compiler automatically build against the Windows 10 SDK:
    a. Windows 10 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).
    b. Visual Studio 2015 (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx).
    c. Windows 10 SDK (https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads/windows-10-sdk).
4. There are also two locations that must contain the proper files (both are the default locations if [3] is completed properly):
    a. C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\amd64\ml64.exe (location of the assembly compiler).
    b. C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.10240.0\ucrt\x64 (location of ucrt.lib, the newest library for Windows 10 CRT methods).
5. All required features were added, and all of the provided test files run correctly.
6. The following extra features were added:
    a. Language features and grammar additions:
        - LessEqual, GreaterEqual, NotEqual, Equal, Mod, Divide, Not
        - instanceof
        - Null checking in code (obj == null)
        - String literals ("String!")
        - String literal addition ("String " + "Another " + "string " + 5)
        - Expression statement ( "while ((n = n.next()) != null)" )
        - for-loop
        - Iterators (++, --, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
        - Empty println()
        - Method return type of void
        - Return from anywhere in method (and check for at least one return statement)
        - Variable declaration anywhere and scope checking
        - Declaration and assignment in one
        - System.in.readline (reads a line of input from user)
        - System.compiler.destroy (frees a block of memory)
        - System.compiler.atol (char array to long)
        - Hex numbers
        - Allow more than three method arguments
    b. Runtime checking and features:
        - Null checking with location
        - Freed memory block checking
        - Array bounds checking with location
        - Memory allocation checking of less than 1 GB
        - Insertion of runtime strings by compiler
    c. Other differences:
        - No C bootstrap needed
        - Built only against ucrtd.lib
        - Built in C#
        - Uses Microsoft convention with proper use of shadow space, etc.
